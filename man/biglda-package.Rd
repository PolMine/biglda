\description{
Package for fast LDA topic modelling for big corpora.
}
\details{
The `ParallelTopicModel` class from the Machine Learning for Language
Toolkit 'mallet' offers a fast implementation of an LDA topic model that
yields good results. The purpose of the 'biglda' package is to offer a
seamless and fast interface to the Java classes of 'mallet' so that the
multicore implementation of the LDA algorithm can be used. The `as_LDA()`
function can be used to map the mallet model on the `LDA_Gibbs` class
from the widely used `topicanalysis` package.

The mallet Java package is not shipped with the "biglda" package. It needs to
be installed explicitly using the `mallet_install` function. If mallet
is not yet available, a warning will be issued upon loading biglda to install
mallet.

The R package "mallet" that has been around for a while it the traditional
interface to the "mallet" Java package for R users. However, the a
`RTopicModel` class (cp.
\href{https://github.com/mimno/Mallet/blob/af1fcb1f3e6561afac28f4331e4e0d735b3d11b4/src/cc/mallet/topics/RTopicModel.java}{code
at GitHub} is used as an interface to the `ParallelTopicModel` class,
hiding the method to define the number of cores to be used from the R used,
thus limiting the potential to speed up the computation of a topic model
using multiple threads. What is more, functionality for full access to the
computed model is hidden, inhibiting the extraction of the information the
mallet LDA topic model that is required to map the topic model on the
LDA_Gibbs topic model.

Note that it is not possible to use the R packages "biglda" and "mallet" in
parallel. If "mallet" is loaded, it will put its Java Archive on the
classpath of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making the latest version of the
`ParallelTopicModel` class inaccessible and causing errors that may be
difficult to understand. Therefore, a warning will be issued when "biglda"
may detect that the JAR included in the "mallet" package is in the classpath.
